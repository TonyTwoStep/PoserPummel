**Poser Pummel is a retro style 2D skateboarding platformer/shooter game created entirely in Python.**

Basic Game Overview:
  - The player rides his skateboard to traverse many platformer levels while shooting enemies and racing against the clock.
  - Each level has a specific number of enemies and seconds alloted to the player with increasing difficulty throughout.
  - There are three levels per each zone and each zone contains different enemies with their own unique skill and movesets.
  - The player has three lives and a life is lost if time runs out or the player collides with an enemy.

### Media Resources
All graphics (player/enemy sprites, platforms, start/game over screen, loading screens, etc) besides level wallpapers are original work and were created in Adobe Photoshop CC. The wallpapers were adapted from vecteezy images which is a free vector website.

The game theme song and all sound effects are original work and were created using my Roland JD-XI synthasizer and Audacity utilizing some bitcrushing plugins.
