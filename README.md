**Poser Pummel is a retro style 2D skateboarding platformer/shooter game created entirely in Python.**

Basic Game Overview:
  - The player rides his skateboard to traverse many platformer levels while shooting enemies and racing against the clock.
  - Each level has a specific number of enemies and seconds alloted to the player with increasing difficulty throughout.
  - There are three levels per each zone and each zone contains different enemies with their own unique skill and movesets.
  - The player has three lives and a life is lost if time runs out or the player collides with an enemy.

## Dependencies
Poser Pummel only requires that the client computer have Python 2.7+ and Pygame installed to function properly.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - main page for Python which includes installers for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) - download and installation instructions for Pygame on various OS's.

## Installation 
The project files themselves are all self contained and can be cloned or downloaded from this repository on any system with Python and Pygame installed.

Alternatively Windows 64-bit users can the .msi installer which does not require Python nor Pygame be installed as portable versions of both are packaged within the installation directory. 
* [Download the MSI Installer Here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/45yoge5d4wjtkuf/PoserPummel-1.0-amd64.msi/file)

### Media Resources
All graphics (player/enemy sprites, platforms, start/game over screen, loading screens, etc) besides level wallpapers are original work and were created in Adobe Photoshop CC. The wallpapers were adapted from vecteezy images which is a free vector website.

The game theme song and all sound effects are original work and were created using my Roland JD-XI synthasizer and Audacity utilizing some bitcrushing plugins.
